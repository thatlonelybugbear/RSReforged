# RSReforged Integration API

RSReforged rewrites chat-message DOM and triggers full re-renders to deliver its quick-roll UI. That conflicts with any other module that also decorates chat cards by hooking Foundry's `renderChatMessageHTML` or `dnd5e.renderChatMessage` directly — hook order is non-deterministic, and RSR's `.remove()` / `.replaceWith()` calls can clobber another module's work.

This document describes the `rsreforged.*` hook surface RSR emits so third-party modules can decorate RSR-rendered cards at deterministic points in the lifecycle.

The hooks listed here are **public API**. They follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — breaking changes require a major-version bump and a changelog entry. See the [Versioning](#versioning) section below for the full bump-rule table.

## The Three Rules

Before you write a listener, accept these constraints.

### 1. Synchronous only

`Hooks.callAll` does not await listeners. If your handler is `async`, RSR will not wait for the promise to settle. By the time your async work completes, the next re-render may have already replaced the DOM you were holding a reference to. Do synchronous DOM work inside the hook; defer anything else (network, sheet rendering, dialog) outside the hook with your own coordination.

### 2. Must be idempotent

`message.update()` calls inside RSR re-fire the entire render hook chain on the new HTML. Your listener will run again on the same logical message, against new DOM nodes. Listeners that inject content must:

- Check for their own marker class / data attribute before inserting, OR
- Replace the existing instance instead of appending a duplicate, OR
- Use stable IDs and `replaceWith()` on re-fire.

```js
// Wrong — produces N copies after N rerolls
Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent", (msg, html) => {
    html.find('.rsr-section-attack').append('<div class="my-decoration">…</div>');
});

// Right — idempotent
Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent", (msg, html) => {
    html.find('.my-decoration').remove(); // or .find('.my-decoration').length && return
    html.find('.rsr-section-attack').append('<div class="my-decoration">…</div>');
});
```

### 3. `preRender` without `render` is possible

RSR's `_injectContent` can detect that a roll message is a child of a parent activity card, merge the roll into the parent via `message.update()`, then `message.delete()` the child. In that case:

- `rsreforged.preRenderChatMessageContent` fires for the child message.
- `rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent` does **not** fire for the child (it was deleted).
- The parent message receives its own full lifecycle on the resulting re-render.

Treat `preRender` and `render` as independent events that may or may not be paired. Do not stash state across the pair expecting a guaranteed teardown.

## Hook Reference

All hook names use the `rsreforged.` prefix. All call `Hooks.callAll` (so listener errors are swallowed, return values are ignored).

### `rsreforged.preRenderChatMessageContent`

Fires at the top of RSR's `_injectContent`, **before any DOM is removed**. This is your only chance to read the dnd5e-native chat card before RSR strips it.

| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| `message` | `ChatMessage5e` | The message being rendered |
| `html` | `jQuery` | The content node RSR was passed (usually `.message-content`) |
| `type` | `string` | RSR's roll-type enum (literal string values, from `src/utils/roll.js` `ROLL_TYPE`): `"attack"`, `"damage"`, `"roll"` (formula), `"skill"`, `"ability"` (ability check), `"save"`, `"death"` (death save), `"tool"`, `"activity"` |

**Use case:** wm5e snapshotting `<a class="wm5e-mastery-reference">` anchors before RSR removes the dnd5e card that contains them, so they can be re-attached in the post hook.

### `rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent`

Fires at the bottom of `_injectContent`, after `_setupCardListeners`. RSR has finished its DOM rewrite; this is the primary decoration point.

Signature identical to `preRenderChatMessageContent`.

**Use case:** AC5E attaching `data-tooltip` attributes to save/check buttons. The attribute survives until the next re-render, at which point this hook fires again and AC5E reapplies it.

### `rsreforged.renderRoll`

Fires at the end of each section render — once per attack roll, once per damage roll, once per formula roll. For damage, fires from both the RSR-mode path and the native-mode early-return path.

| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| `message` | `ChatMessage5e` | The message being rendered |
| `html` | `jQuery` | The content node RSR was passed |
| `type` | `string` | One of `"attack"`, `"damage"`, `"roll"` (the formula section — value matches `ROLL_TYPE.FORMULA` in `src/utils/roll.js`) |
| `sectionHtml` | `jQuery` | The just-inserted section node (e.g. `.rsr-section-attack`, or the native damage card when `mode === "native"`) |

`sectionHtml` is provided so listeners don't have to query the whole card to find what RSR just inserted.

**Use case:** decorating only attack-roll sections (e.g. wm5e mastery links live on attack rolls, so a listener can early-return on other types).

### `rsreforged.renderApplyDamageButtons`

Fires at the end of `_injectApplyDamageButtons` when RSR's damage-apply UI (`×2 / ÷2 / temp HP / heal / etc.`) is wired up.

| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| `message` | `ChatMessage5e` | The message being rendered |
| `html` | `jQuery` | The content node |
| `buttonsHtml` | `jQuery` | The `.rsr-damage` container the apply-damage buttons were appended to |

**Use case:** adding custom damage-apply variants (e.g. resistance/vulnerability toggles).

## Lifecycle

```
Roll message created
  ↓
Foundry: renderChatMessageHTML fires
  ↓
RSR's listener calls processChatMessage(message, html)
  ↓
  ├─ activity message? → _injectContent(message, "activity", html)
  │     ↓
  │   rsreforged.preRenderChatMessageContent  ← fires here
  │     ↓
  │   [RSR removes .dice-roll, .dnd5e2.chat-card, [data-action=…]]
  │     ↓
  │   [_injectAttackRoll]  → rsreforged.renderRoll ("attack")
  │   [_injectDamageRoll]  → rsreforged.renderRoll ("damage")
  │   [_injectFormulaRoll] → rsreforged.renderRoll ("roll")
  │   [_injectApplyDamageButtons] → rsreforged.renderApplyDamageButtons
  │     ↓
  │   _setupCardListeners
  │     ↓
  │   rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent  ← fires here
  │
  └─ other roll types → _injectContent fires the same hooks
                        (skill/save/check rolls fire pre + post only;
                         renderRoll fires only for attack/damage/formula sections)
```

When RSR calls `message.update()` (re-roll for advantage, damage application, etc.), Foundry re-fires `renderChatMessageHTML`, which restarts this entire chain on the new HTML.

## Worked Example 1: Re-attach mastery links after RSR re-render

Mirrors the wm5e use case from [RSReforged #13](https://github.com/arrowedisgaming/RSReforged/issues/13). Mastery links live inside the dnd5e attack chat card, which RSR removes.

**The critical wrinkle:** in the quick-roll path, `preRender` fires on a *child* roll message that RSR then merges into a parent activity card and deletes. The matching `renderRoll("attack")` fires later on the *parent* — a different `ChatMessage` instance. A `WeakMap` (or any map) keyed by the message you see in `preRender` will miss in `renderRoll`.

Resolve the merge target in `preRender` using the same lookup RSR uses internally (`getOriginatingMessage`, `getAssociatedMessage`, `flags.dnd5e.originatingMessage`), and key the snapshot by the parent's id when a parent exists.

```js
// In your module's init:
const snapshots = new Map(); // keyed by parent id when merging, else by message id

function resolveTargetId(message) {
    // Mirrors src/utils/chat.js _injectContent parent resolution. When a child
    // attack/damage roll will be merged into a parent activity card, the post
    // hooks fire on the parent — so we have to key under the parent's id here.
    // All four fallbacks must match RSR's resolution order, including the final
    // message.system.message case used by dnd5e versions that expose the parent
    // only through the system data model.
    const origin = message.getOriginatingMessage?.();
    if (origin && origin !== message) return origin.id;
    const associated = message.getAssociatedMessage?.();
    if (associated && associated !== message) return associated.id;
    const originId = message.flags?.dnd5e?.originatingMessage;
    if (originId) return originId;
    const systemMessageId = message.system?.message;
    if (systemMessageId) return systemMessageId;
    return message.id;
}

Hooks.on("rsreforged.preRenderChatMessageContent", (message, html, type) => {
    if (type !== "activity" && type !== "attack") return;
    const links = html.find('a.wm5e-mastery-reference').detach();
    if (!links.length) return;
    snapshots.set(resolveTargetId(message), links);
});

Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderRoll", (message, html, rollType, sectionHtml) => {
    if (rollType !== "attack") return;
    const links = snapshots.get(message.id);
    if (!links?.length) return;
    // Re-attach inside the RSR attack section, idempotently.
    sectionHtml.find('a.wm5e-mastery-reference').remove();
    sectionHtml.append(links.clone(true));
});
```

Why `Map` instead of `WeakMap`: in the merge path, the key is a string id, not the child message object (which gets garbage-collected after `message.delete()`). Cloning with `true` preserves event handlers. The `.remove()` before `.append()` is the idempotency guard for re-renders.

**When does the merge case actually fire?** Quick-roll attacks and damage rolls on activities that RSR is handling. Plain skill checks, saves, and tool checks don't merge — `preRender` and `renderRoll` (if it fires) run on the same message, so the parent-resolution helper returns `message.id` and the code path collapses to the simple case.

**`.supplement` preservation (4.7.1+).** RSR now keeps dnd5e's `<p class="supplement">` wrappers across the rebuild — including the mastery anchors, damage-on-save notes, and legendary-resistance flags that `_enrichAttackTargets` and friends attach. Surviving and rescued supplements end up under `.rsr-section-attack` carrying *both* `.supplement` (original) and `.rsr-supplement` (for RSR's own styling). Modules that previously had to walk the inner anchors individually (as the snapshot/re-attach example above does) can now also query `.supplement` directly on the rebuilt DOM. The example above still works and is more defensive than relying on the wrapper — keep using it if you want belt-and-braces preservation, especially for module-specific decorations that live alongside dnd5e's content inside the supplement.

## Worked Example 2: Re-apply tooltips on save buttons

Mirrors the AC5E use case from [RSReforged #3](https://github.com/arrowedisgaming/RSReforged/issues/3). AC5E annotates `[data-action=rollSave]` / `[data-action=rollCheck]` buttons with computed `data-tooltip` attributes. RSR doesn't usually remove those buttons (only the attack/damage/formula ones), but a re-render still rebuilds the DOM, stripping the attribute.

```js
function applyAc5eTooltip(message, html) {
    const tooltip = message.flags?.['automated-conditions-5e']?.tooltipObj?.save;
    if (!tooltip) return;
    html.find('button[data-action=rollSave], button[data-action=rollCheck]')
        .attr('data-tooltip', tooltip)
        .removeAttr('title');
}

Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent", applyAc5eTooltip);
```

Single post hook is enough. Listener is naturally idempotent — `.attr()` overwrites rather than appends.

## Versioning

Hook names, argument positions, and argument types listed in this document are stable. Changes will follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) conventions:

- **Patch bump**: bug fixes that don't change the hook contract.
- **Minor bump**: adding a new hook, adding a new optional trailing argument to an existing hook.
- **Major bump**: removing a hook, renaming a hook, reordering or changing the type of existing arguments. Old hooks will continue to fire for at least one minor cycle before removal.

If you ship a module that depends on these hooks, pin the minimum RSR version in your `module.json` (`relationships.requires[].compatibility.minimum`). The introducing version is recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) under the release entry that lists the Integration API addition.

## Troubleshooting

- **My hook fires multiple times per roll.** Expected. `message.update()` re-renders. Make your listener idempotent.
- **My hook fires for the wrong message.** RSR may merge child roll messages into parents and delete the child. Filter on `message.flags?.rsreforged?.renderAttack` (or similar) if you only want to act on the merged parent.
- **My async work runs after RSR's next re-render.** Don't do async work inside the hook — `Hooks.callAll` doesn't await. Synchronously snapshot what you need; defer work.
- **My listener never fires.** Confirm you're on the RSR version that introduced the Integration API (see [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)). Add a one-line log: `Hooks.on("rsreforged.renderChatMessageContent", (m,h,t) => console.log("rsr", t));`. Make a roll. If you see nothing, file an issue.
